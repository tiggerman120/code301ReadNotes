# bearer authy

## review research and discussion

Write the following steps in the correct order:

Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Receive authorization code
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Register your application to get a client_id and 
client_secret
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Receive access token

What can you do with an authorization code?
you can use an authorization code to request an access token from third party auth

What can you do with an access token?
you can use it to gain access to the users resources for the time amount specified

Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
it is managed by a third party so there is an added extra layer of security

## definitions

Client ID: username
Client Secret: password
Authentication Endpoint: the database storing credentials to authenticate entered user credentials
Access Token Endpoint: its where you make a request for an access token for a user
API Endpoint: its where the app requests data from a third party
Authorization Code: code granted after authentication of user credentials
Access Token: token granted to app by user to gain access to resources for time amount specified

the only thing I had heard about previously is access tokens but I thought they do what authentication tokens do so I have better clarity about that

I'm hoping to learn more about mongoDB and user authentication i don't have a third thing
