# Application State with Redux

## review research and discussion

### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

cookies can persist through page refresh

### Explain 3rd party cookies.

they are bits of information stored by a third party(the server) on your local machine so that certain information will persist through visits to their page

### How do pixel tags work?

they are invisible 1 pixel images hosted by the ad servers domain on a webpage that allows the ad server to store cookies and track relevant information

## vocabulary

### cookies

Cookies are a simple technology that have been around since the early days of the web. They are pieces of code that web servers use to put information on a user’s browser, and then retrieve that information at a later time for various uses. For example, YouTube sets a cookie on your browser to remember your username and volume settings so you don’t have to input those every time. Cookies are privacy conscious by design, so that only the server domain that sets a cookie is able to retrieve it.​

### authorization

verifying user credentials or creating user credentials generally by inputting a username and password(or email and password) so that the user may be granted appropriate roles

### access control

control based on user roles that are granted by a successful auth

### conditional rendering

rendering components on a webpage only under certain circumstances such as something being clicked or a form being submitted
