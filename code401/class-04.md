## questions

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

  1. better program design and higher quality code
    When writing tests, programmers first have to define a goal they will achieve with the code piece.

  2. Detailed project documentation
    When writing tests for particular requirements, programmers immediately create a strict and detailed specification.

  3. TDD reduces the time required for project development
    maintenance of an application made without Test Driven Development implementation may take twice as much time as of an application created with TDD.

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
to set a timeout after or before each test suite

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
it can take 30% longer to initially develop an app using TDD

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
es6 classes can be extended
Why REST?
It is a standardized framework with which to build API's so that utilization of API's is easier

## definitions

function programming: functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program.
<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming assisted with this definition-->
object-oriented programming (OOP):Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of properties, and code, in the form of methods <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming assisted with this answer-->
class: class is a type of constructor that allows you to easily "extend" or build subclasses with access to the main classes properties
super: The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. <!--https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super-->
this: this is an objects property accessor within this's lexical scope.
test driven development: Test Driven Development is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. <!--https://www.codica.com/blog/test-driven-development-benefits/ assisted with this answer -->
jest: Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework
continuous integration: Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. <!--https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration assisted with this answer-->
REST: REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.<!--https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest-->
data model: data modeling is a way to modularize and model your data providing some key benefits such as providing a dictionary to look up properties. it makes your code more readable. and provides you with a single point to change if needed


I have more clarity on the use of SQL, the differences between a relational and non relational db, and jest testing

im hoping to learn about mongoDB templating and jest testing.

i am most excited about implementing mongoDB with a front end with forms and paginated views
