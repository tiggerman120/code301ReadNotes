# ethics

i think it is a good and ethical thing to have a code of ethics. It is important that computing professionals use their skills to improve things rather than to do malicious intent. Avoiding harm is especially important as that could cause lawsuits. Not discriminating is also very important. diversity is our strength.

Writing unethical code is a bad thing. It leaves open the doorway for malicious practices. One such practice is unethical drug pushing for big pharma. Even with coding your decisions could be life or death even if they are abstract. Life and death decisions are tough.

self driving cars are a good thing. there is a moral dilemma about who decides who lives or dies and coding plays a part in that. pre programmed self driving cars will have to make no win decisions which means computing professionals will be making no win situations. I think that the best answer is what your gut tells you.
