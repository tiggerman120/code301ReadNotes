## images

Images can be used to affect user impression on website and their overall liking to it.

It is good practice to store images in a seperate folder on your VSC

<img src=""> to add images url or file path they need a title and alt text should be there as well(ADA compliance)

You can control image height and width using `height` and `width` but those values are increasinglybeing managed by CSS

image placement matters
    before a paragraph will put the paragraph on a new line after the image

    inside the start of a paragraph will align the first row of text with the bottom of the image

    in the middle of a paragraph will place the image in between the words of the paragraph its inserted into

## rules for images
