# MORE CSS YAY ART CLASS IN A TECH SCHOOL WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED I TOTALLY LIKE ART IT IS MY FAVORITE THING EVER

## key concepts in tech school art class

css treats html elements as block level(put yer stuff in a box its own box)
or its an inline element which flows with the text around it

if you put your box in another box the outer box is now the parent. we call it daddybox.

you can control positioning with normal, relative, absolute, fixed, and floating. (but in a job youll use a template so this crap probably doesnt even matter probably but lets learn it for the sake of understanding how those templates work i guess.
position:static = normal flow one on top of other
position:relative = relative flow) moves in relation with normal flow so babies sit in from their daddyboxes
position:absolute stay there and dont move and you wont affect anything elses position(sounds like a good way to break shit)(put your hands up)
position:fixed will do what absolute does but affect other stuffs position this will scroll with your page(less breaky more wth move you dumb box)
overlap with z-index
float shit somewhere with float
clear floats with clear(why not just delete the float in your code? why is there code to delete code when you COULD JUST DELETE THE CODE THIS MAKES NO SENSE)

width float margin for multicolumns in your stuff

960-1k pixels is your standard for dealing with screen size variance.

use fixed width layouts because liquid layouts look like they want to break and they use percentages. Skip the math screw that
