### Chapter 1

This chapters describes the basic features of a website and the frame to build them with. Like building blocks and a wireframe.

### Chapter 8

Use ID attributes. Stop forgetting they make life easier.
Use class attributes where useful. Don't know what that is yet but I will find out!

Use div tags to divy up your website better. You know you want to.

### Chapter 17

HTML5 added a the header article and aside tags to substitute div id's for structure building.

Use article tag for stand-alone text entries
Use aside tags for related but seperate content like a glossary or pullquote.
Use section tag to seperate multiple distinct areas of the webpage.

### Chapter 18

Things like the target audience matter for building a webpage especially for art choices.
Use a site map to help organize and visualize your website. It is a useful visual tool to keep you grounded. Use a wireframe to design your webpage.

### Javascript Chapter 1

Javascript is your websites elctricity. It makes your submission forms work it makes your embeds work. It can be used to display data on a webpage better or to reload a part of a page(make sure to div it out)
Javascript is a programmatic language and computers are stupid. You need to be specific. What you name your variables doesnt matter insofar as making the code work! Just call it what you want it to do.
How best to get the computer to do what i want it to? What i think programming is so far
