# Node.js

## what is Node.js?

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

Next we come to one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. This isn’t a new concept, and was first attempted by Netscape way back in 1994. Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages. 

In very simplistic terms, when you connect to a traditional server, such as Apache, it will spawn a new thread to handle the request. In a language such as PHP or Ruby, any subsequent I/O operations (for example, interacting with a database) block the execution of your code until the operation has completed. 

Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

We start by requiring Node’s native HTTP module. We then use its createServer method to create a new web server object, to which we pass an anonymous function. This function will be invoked for every new connection that’s made to the server.
The anonymous function is called with two arguments (request and response). These contain the request from the user and the response, which we use to send back a 200 HTTP status code, along with our “Hello World!” message.

Finally, we tell the server to listen for incoming requests on port 3000, and output a message to the terminal to let us know it’s running.

```JS

const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');

```

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven

Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

Finally, JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.

For example Node can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. It can also be used to write your own command line tool.

Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
