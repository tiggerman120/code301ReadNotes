# diversity is our strength


video gaming as a child is thought to be a great pusher of people into the technology sector as adults
In the 1980's there was a wave of low-quality games being pushed onto the market which caused a "video game recession"
the market cap dropped by 97% and the data showed that only boys we're still buying games. This pushed retailers to target their advertising to boys. going so far as to name the "market-saving" hand-held the gameBOY.

This resulted in women being pushed away from the technology sector through lack of exposure and the resulting "bro-culture" that can arise in an overwhelmingly male environment.

All of this has led to women(and minorities in large because the industry is also largely white and male not just male) being vastly under represented in the tech sector even now in 2020.

Diversity brings a whole host of benefits to companies by bring more viewpoints, different ideas, and just different cultures to the table to help make a product more inviting and just better through more variance in design. According to Professor Scott E. PAge of the university of Michigan "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it. It is an ideal that is Echoed by CEO's and leaders in the tech industry like Mr Brian Krzanich of Intel who is on record stating that "A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results."

The resulting improvements in product creation also drive better business results for companies. Their products appeal to larger markets better with more diverse team. It is something you can measure over the past decade with the changing tides in the culture of the tech industry and the rising rates of women and minorities in the sector. the leaps and bounds of technological advancement has also been a great driver but that may have changed how you see and play games but diversity has changed your games and made them better(looking at you ANIMAL CROSSING :)))) )

there are noted links between racial and gender diversity and better business performance in companies as measured by a study of 177 banks across the USA.
